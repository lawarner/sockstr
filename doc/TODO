Some planned enhancements to sockstr        Updated: 5/27/2013
------------------------------------        ------------------
Implement a pure async callback mode where a single thread is constantly
delivering new data from socket.

Allow to pass a bigger buffer to StreamBuf

Support IPv6 address resolution (Work in progress)

Port to Android, iOS.

Add more protocols besides Http.  Possibly use a ProtocolBuf interface.

Authenticate server, more options for TLS.
- Be able to detect a TLS session on a socket and switch to TLS mode.

Fully implement OAuth classes.

Change to a better config/build system. I hate the autoconf/automake tools since
they are overly complex and only seem to work well on Linux.  I'm considering 
using cmake.
